# Project Euler

Project Euler was started by Colin Hughes (a.k.a euler) in October 2001 as a sub-section on mathschallenge.net. It is a project that gives complex math problems that can only be solved using programming languages. You can use any language you wish to use to solve these problems.

I have separated my results for each problem into specific folders for each different type of computer language.
